
//Challenge8:
//Create a Challenge8 component in the components directory.
//The component should retrieve and display the names and images from the players.js file in the data directory.
//The component should have two columns: Active and Inactive
//Clicking each image in the Active column will move the player to the Inactive column
//Clicking each image in the Inactive column will not do anything(for this challenge)
//Both active and inactive columns should keep a count of their players.
//Add CSS rules for the hover state of the players in the active column.
//add a CSS rule to the App.css file so the component's body is indented.
//Add a route/link for this component to the Header component.
