/*
    *** Challenge 5 ***
    For this challenge, you will create a search feature
    for the archives
    
    When the user clicks on a search-by-keyword button, it 
    should return a list of all the keywords in all the 
    challenges. The list should only one of each keyword (no
    duplicates).  *** note that there is now a keyword array
    in the ./data/archives.js file for this purpose. there is 
    no need to search the actual code ***

    The keywords (or phrases) displayed on the screen 
    should be clickable. Then, when the user clicks on 
    the keyword, it should then compile a list of every 
    challenge that has that keyword.

    Update App.css as needed.
