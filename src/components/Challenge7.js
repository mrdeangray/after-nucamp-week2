
//Challenge7:
//Create a Challenge7 component in the components directory.
//The component should retrieve and display the names from the players.js file in the data directory.
//The component should also display buttons with the initials of the names.
//Clicking each button will remove the names with that initial.
//The component should also have a "Start Over" button that lists all the names again.
//Add CSS rules to the buttons, so they change color while being hovered over.
//add a CSS rule to the App.css file so the component's body is indented.
//Add a route/link for this component to the Header component.
